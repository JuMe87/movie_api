        <p> this project I will create a REST API for an application called "myFlix" that interacts with a database that stores data about different movies.
            Here is a list of all essential features of this application:
            <li>Return a list of all movies to the user</li>
            <li>Return data (description, genre, director, image URL, whether it is featured or not) about a single movie by title to the user </li>
            <li>Return data about a genre (description) by name/title (e.g., “Thriller”) </li>
            <li>Return data about a director by name</li> 
            <li>Allow new users to register </li>
            <li>Allow users to update their user info </li>
            <li>Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites </li>
            <li>Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites </li>
            <li>Allow  existing users to deregister </li>
        </p>
